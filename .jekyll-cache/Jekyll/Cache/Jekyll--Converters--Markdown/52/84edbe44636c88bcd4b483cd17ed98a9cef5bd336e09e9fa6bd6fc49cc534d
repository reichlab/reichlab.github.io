I"<p>Sheri Fink published <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/03/health/ebola-crisis-passes-but-questions-on-quarantines-persist.html?_r=0">this nice piece</a> in the New York Times yesterday on the legal issues surrounding state-imposed quarantines on travelers returning from countries with widespread Ebola transmission. In addition to the toll these policies have had on the individuals who have been put under quarantine, I took away from this article that there is still a need for better data on and communication about the risks of travelers being infected with Ebola. As it happens, this is the topic of my talk today at the <a href="http://www.epidemics.elsevier.com/">Epidemics5 conference</a>.</p>
