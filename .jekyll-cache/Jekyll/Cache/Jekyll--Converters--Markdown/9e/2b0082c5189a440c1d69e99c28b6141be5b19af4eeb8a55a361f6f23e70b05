I"ğ<p>Here are the slides for my presentation today at the annual MIDAS conference in Atlanta, GA. The talk summarizes recent work led by post-doc Evan Ray on creating interpretable â€œfeature-weighted density ensemblesâ€ for infectious disease forecasting. The paper is currently under review, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10936">the preprint is available on arXiv</a>. Check out the 2017-2018 real-time influenza forecasts from this model available on our <a href="http://reichlab.io/flusight/">flusight app</a>. And here are some slices of the feature-dependent weighting functions for predicting peak incidence for influenza in the U.S.</p>
