I"<p>For the second year in a row, the Reich Lab is participating in the <a href="https://predict.phiresearchlab.org/post/57f3f440123b0f563ece2576">CDC FluSight challenge</a>, a project where teams from around the country submit real-time predictions of influenza to the CDC. The teams use a variety of different models and methods to generate these predictions, from <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004382">an empirical Bayes method that uses Google search data</a> to <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3837">a extended Kalman-filter method that uses humidity data</a> to <a href="https://github.com/reichlab/article-disease-pred-with-kcde/raw/master/inst/article/infectious-disease-prediction-with-kcde.pdf">our kernel conditional density estimation method using recent incidence</a>, and there are many others!</p>

<p>This year, we â€“ well, mostly <a href="https://github.com/elray1">Evan</a> â€“ have developed a new ensemble method that combines predictions from different models. We â€“ mostly <a href="https://github.com/lepisma">Abhinav</a> â€“ also created a visualizer for our predictions. Check it out <a href="https://reichlab.github.io/flusight/">here</a>! Itâ€™s still early in the season, and weâ€™re not seeing much data to suggest that this will be an unusually high or low year, but thatâ€™s largely because there just isnâ€™t much information in the early-season data.
In this post, Iâ€™m going to give you a quick tour under the hood of our ensemble forecasting methodology. At some point, weâ€™ll have an article up on GitHub or arXiv, but for now, this explanation will have to suffice.</p>
