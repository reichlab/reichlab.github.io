I"…<p>As Iâ€™ve been writing up a progress report for <a href="https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9553816">my NIGMS R35 MIRA award</a>, Iâ€™ve been reminded at how much of the work that weâ€™ve been doing is focused on forecasting infrastructure. A common theme in the <a href="http://reichlab.io/">Reich Lab</a> is making <em>operational</em> forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks. The operational aspect means that we focus on everything from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.7488">developing</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005910">adapting</a> statistical methods to be used in forecasting applications to thinking about the data science toolkit that you need to store, evaluate, and visualize forecasts. To that end, in addition to working closely with the CDC in their <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html">FluSight initiative</a>, weâ€™ve been doing a lot of collaborative work on new R packages and data repositories that I hope will be useful beyond the confines of our lab. Some of these projects are fully operational, used in our <a href="http://flusightnetwork.io/">production flu forecasts for CDC</a>, and some have even gone through <a href="https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00231">a level of code peer review</a>. Others are in earlier stages of development. My hope is that in putting this list out there (see below the fold) we will generate some interest (and possibly find some new open-source collaborators) for these projects.</p>
