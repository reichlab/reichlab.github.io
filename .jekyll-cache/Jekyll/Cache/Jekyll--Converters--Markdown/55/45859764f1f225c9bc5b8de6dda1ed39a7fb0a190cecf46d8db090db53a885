I"¸<p>Last week, I attended a Pandemic Influenza Exercise at the US CDC. To be
clear, there is NOT a pandemic occuring right now, but the CDC ran this
exercise where hundreds of staff members and outside observers and
participants came together to practice going through the motions of a
public health response to a major pandemic. As someone who is usually
sheltered from this everyday aspect of public health decision-making,
this was a fascinating window into understanding the careful, if
time-pressured, scientific deliberation that underlies the response to
public health emergencies.</p>
