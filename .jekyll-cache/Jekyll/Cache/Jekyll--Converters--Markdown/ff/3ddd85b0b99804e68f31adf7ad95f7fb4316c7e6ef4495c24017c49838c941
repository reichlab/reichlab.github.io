I"Š<p>I wrote a response to <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md">Siddhartha Mukherjeeâ€™s article â€œA.I. vs. M.D.â€</a> that appeared in the <em>New Yorker</em> last month. While I submitted it as a letter to the editor, they didnâ€™t publish it. In retrospect, perhaps it was a bit long-winded for their curt and pithy letters section. Mukherjeeâ€™s article was published on the heels of Evan submitting <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10936">his latest work on improving the consistency of infectious disease prediction using interpretable model averaging methods</a>. What follows is the letter I submitted.</p>
