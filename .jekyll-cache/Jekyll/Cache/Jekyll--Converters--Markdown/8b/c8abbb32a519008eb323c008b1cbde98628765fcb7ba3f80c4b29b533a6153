I"ó<p>This week I attended a workshop at the CDC about last yearâ€™s <a href="https://predict.phiresearchlab.org/flu/index.html">FluSight challenge</a>, a competition that scores weekly real-time predictions about the course of the influenza season. They are planning another round this year and are hoping to increase the number of teams particiating. Stay tuned to <a href="https://predict.phiresearchlab.org/flu/index.html">this site</a> for more info.</p>

<p>At the workshop, I learned about <a href="http://delphi.midas.cs.cmu.edu/">DELPHIâ€™s</a> real-time epidemiological <a href="https://github.com/undefx/delphi-epidata">data API</a>. The API is linked to various data sources on influenza and dengue, including US CDC flu data, Google Flu Trends, and Wikipedia data. There is <a href="https://github.com/undefx/delphi-epidata#the-api">some documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/undefx/delphi-epidata#code-samples">minimal examples</a>, and this post documents a more robust and complete example for using the API via R. Iâ€™ll note that the CDCâ€™s influenza data, can also be accessed via the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdcfluview</code> R package, which Iâ€™m not going to discuss here and I will focus here on accessing some of the other data sources. Hereâ€™s a teaser of this data that you can also interactively explore on the <a href="http://delphi.midas.cs.cmu.edu/epivis/epivis.html">DELPHI EpiVis website</a>:
